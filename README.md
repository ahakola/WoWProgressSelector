# WoWProgressSelector

My first browser-addon and I'm probably *YOUR DOING IT WRONG*, but at least it works.

When updating your guild's progress at [WoWProgress](https://www.wowprogress.com/), you can select all guild characters for individual update with just one click (click again to deselect all) with this addon.
